This project has data and src mainly

In data/ there are datasets of different types

In src/ there is a datasets/ subdir and a train/ subdir. The datasets/ subdir can be used to determine what type of dataset a given dataset is in the data/ dir.
There will be multiple subdirs in train/ where each subdir is for training a different type of model (probably specific dataset types per model type).
